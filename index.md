## Welcome to the Power Systems CORE Research Group

We develop cutting-edge research on applying machine learning and optimisation to modern energy systems.

- üìç Based at Department of Engineering - Durham University, Durham, UK
- üî¨ Focus areas: Mathematical Modelling of Power Systems, Applications of AI/ML in modern hybrid power systems operational planning and control, advanced statistical modelling for risk evaluation of long-term investment planning of transmission assets, multi-vector energy systems, applications of physics-informed ML in power systems modelling, design of advanced data-driven ML-based decision support tools for multi-vector energy systems, real-time control and operation of power systems
- Our facilities: we operate the Durham Smart Grid laboratory which hosts several high performance workstations dedicated for Machine Learning applications as well as a range of real-time digital simulators for studying power systems operational resilience and designing control methods for microgrids with high levels of variable renewable energy resource
